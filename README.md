# Machine Learning Assignment

This repository contains three machine learning tasks developed as part of a training assignment. Each task focuses on a specific type of ML problem: Regression, Classification and Clustering.

## 1. Regression Task
- **Objective:** Predict cryptocurrency closing prices over time.
- **Models Used:** 
  - Linear Regression  
  - Gradient Boosting  
  - Random Forest

---

## 2. Classification Task
- **Objective:** Predict whether the price will move **up** or **down** based on selected features.
- **Models Used:** 
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - Decision Tree

---

## 3. Clustering Task
- **Objective:** Group data into **bullish**, **bearish** and **sideways** clusters to analyze market trends.
- **Techniques Used:** 
  - KMeans Clustering  
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
  - t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

## Project Structure
Each task is organized into its own folder with :
- Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) for exploratory data analysis, model development, Feature Selection, HyperParameter Tuning, Pipeline and Model Evaluation
- Python scripts (`.py`) for pipeline code  
- Serialized models (`.pkl`) for reuse
